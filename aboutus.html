      <p>
        I am a graduate student at the University of South Florida, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Business Analytics.
        With over 3 years of experience as a Senior Systems Engineer at Infosys, I have built robust data pipelines, deployed analytics dashboards,
        and driven automation for large-scale systems.

      <h2>How GearTrack Was Built</h2>
      <p>
        GearTrack was developed as part of the <em>"Application Development for Analytics"</em> course. 
        The project requirements included implementing a structured, responsive website around a pre-assigned theme, <strong>sports equipment</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I began by translating the theme into a practical layout using HTML and CSS, focusing on clean design, 
        category-based organization, and user-friendly navigation. I used a modular approach to construct individual pages and styled them with reusable CSS classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout development, I applied responsive design principles, managed version control via GitHub, and deployed using Cyberduck. 
        I incorporated instructor feedback and implemented enhancements like hover effects, subtle transitions, and interactive visuals to improve usability.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project helped me strengthen my front-end development skills and demonstrate the ability to take a given theme and turn it into a polished, interactive website.
